# Overview

This project is a pure front-end project, developed based on vue.js and introduced the UI library of vue element.

# Usage
**Operating environment requirements**
 - Mac/Linux/Windows
 - yarn/npm

**Build project**

    git clone git@github.com:bobyeoh/todo-frontend.git
    cd todo-frontend
    yarn install
    yarn serve

**  Preview**

	Local: http://localhost:8080/
	Remote: https://todo.001.gs/

	Since I provide both front-end and back-end systems, the front-end system doesn't provide mock data. After the program runs, it will directly connect to the server deployed in AWS.
